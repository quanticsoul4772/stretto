# Implementation Plan: Stretto Baseline

**Branch**: `001-stretto-baseline` | **Date**: 2026-07-06 | **Spec**: [spec.md](spec.md)

**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-stretto-baseline/spec.md`

**Note**: This plan captures the architectural decisions that produced the shipped generative ambient music synth (Stretto) through ~90 merged PRs, serving as the baseline for future specs (e.g., `002-master-limiter-compressor`). All design choices here were validated against `regression_16s.sha256` and the multi-seed integration test.

## Summary

Build a tiny native C99 generative ambient music synthesizer. A single binary producing continuous, deterministic-but-evolving music over minutes; reproducible across `--seed N`; live-modifiable via keyboard; recorded to 16-bit 48 kHz stereo WAV on demand. Architecture is a synth pipeline (per-voice synthesis → voice mix → reverb → delay → saturation → compressor → limiter) fed by a six-layer generative state machine (modal-scale Markov, L-system melody, 2nd-order Markov counter, chord-progression Markov, cellular-automaton degree mask, motif-recall ring buffer), gated by a 4-section song-form crossfader. Single 128 KB arena allocator; no `malloc` after startup.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: C99 (gcc). No C++; no external runtime beyond libc + libpulse (Linux) / winmm (Windows).

**Primary Dependencies**:
- libc (always)
- libpulse (Linux live audio); winmm (Windows live audio)
- UPX (Windows release pack target)
- gcc / MinGW cross-toolchain (Windows cross-compile)
- gcov + bash (coverage)
- python3 + numpy (multi-seed audio analysis)

**Storage**: N/A at runtime; single 128 KB static arena (`arena.c`); all `.bss` Markov tables, ring buffers, wavetable, scale tables built at compile time by `gen_*_table.c` programs.

**Testing**:
- `make test` — bit-exact 16-s SHA-256 (`golden/regression_16s.sha256`)
- `make test-unit` — per-module unit (`tests/unit/test_*.c`)
- `make test-multiseed` — 4-seed audio-characteristic bounds (peak, RMS, clip, centroid, ZCR)
- `make test-smoke` — live-mode 2-second timeout, no TTY
- `make coverage` — per-file gates via gcov
- `make win && make winpack` — Windows cross-compile + UPX

**Target Platform**: Linux (PulseAudio default output, fallback scripted `--no-ui`) and Windows 10+ (`ENABLE_VIRTUAL_TERMINAL_PROCESSING`, waveOut). Modern terminals with ANSI support.

**Project Type**: Native CLI / interactive generative-music tool. Single-binary, single-process. No daemon, no library form, no plugin host.

**Performance Goals**:
- 48 kHz × 2-ch × 16-bit interleaved PCM streaming
- < 1 s cold-launch to first audio buffer
- Live-mode key response ≤ one audio buffer (~21 ms)
- Uptime ≥ 30 min unattended, no clipping, no drift

**Constraints**:
- Packed Windows `.exe` ≤ 48 KB (CI-failing past this; last ~37 KB)
- Stripped Linux binary soft-target 24 KB (~40 KB with libpulse; Makefile warns past target)
- Single-binary, no shared library form
- All dynamic allocation from a 128 KB arena (no `malloc`, no `free`)
- Audio generation MUST NOT read `time()` (determinism)

**Scale/Scope**: One repo, one binary, one feature (the synth) serving as the baseline against which future specs are validated. ~90 PRs already merged; future changes are bounded by `--seed N` reproducibility.

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

| Principle | Status | Evidence |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| **I. Tiny Native Binary (NON-NEGOTIABLE)** | ✅ PASS | CI on every PR enforces ≤48 KB UPX-packed Windows; `Makefile` `size` warns on Linux 24 KB target. Last packed ~37 KB. No library form. |
| **II. C99 Only** | ✅ PASS | Build is pure `gcc -std=c99`. No C++ symbols. Build-time utilities (`gen_*_table.c`) also C99. |
| **III. Deterministic (NON-NEGOTIABLE)** | ✅ PASS (v1.0.1) | `--seed N` produces byte-identical output on supported build targets (Linux glibc + Windows winmm, both little-endian x86). Runtime engine is integer-only (int16/int32/int64); build-time tables round doubles to integers committed to headers; WAV writer is native-endian RIFF. Bit-exact 16-s SHA-256 + 4-seed multi-render integration tests gate the Linux runner; cross-platform WAV byte-identity is by code construction (no Windows runner in CI). |
| **IV. Ambient + Algorithmic Aesthetic** | ✅ PASS | 6-scale modal Markov; 2nd-order Markov counter; chord-progression Markov every 2 bars; L-system over `u U d D r .`; 96-bar section crossfader; ring-buffer motif recall; cellular-automaton degree mask. |
| **V. Cleanly Modular** | ✅ PASS | One `.c`/`.h` per concern; one-way dependency direction documented in `ARCHITECTURE.md`. No externs across module boundaries. |
| **VI. Test Discipline (NON-NEGOTIABLE)** | ✅ PASS | `tests/unit/test_*.c` per pure-synth module; per-file coverage gates: 95 % (arena/effects/voice/section/density/motif/mixer), 90 % (gen/lsystem/chord_progression/wav/main). Interactive modules (`ui.c`, `keys.c`, `audio_pulse.c`) excluded with rationale. |
| **VII. No Partial Features** | ✅ PASS | Zero `TODO` in committed code; zero placeholder `(void)` casts; every PR ships a bit-exact golden (regenerated in the same PR when intentional). |
| **VIII. Document Why, Not What** | ✅ PASS | Comments capture invariants (FR-009a glide determinism), magic numbers (reverb coefficients, detune cents), and workaround context. `README.md` / `ARCHITECTURE.md` / `CHANGELOG.md` refreshed in dedicated `docs/*` PRs. |
| **IX. Cross-Platform From Day One** | ✅ PASS | PulseAudio + winmm are first-class. CI on every PR runs Linux + Windows cross-compile + UPX. Platform code isolated in `audio_pulse.c` / `audio_winmm.c` and `#ifdef _WIN32` blocks (see `ui.c`). |
| **X. Generative > Random** | ✅ PASS | Six interacting layers (scale Markov → chord Markov → CA mask → L-system melody → 2nd-order Markov counter → motif ring buffer) plus 96-bar section state machine. Pure randomness is a tool, not a goal. |

All gates pass. No violations require justification.

## Project Structure

├── spec.md              # Feature specification (this baseline)
├── plan.md              # This file

└── tasks.md             # Phase 2 — task inventory stub (regenerated by /speckit-tasks as needed)

# data-model.md + contracts/ deliberately omitted — see below.
```

`data-model.md` was not generated because every entity (`Voice`, `Scale`, `Chord function`, `Active mask`, `Section`, `Motif phrase`, `Render request`) is already fully enumerated in `spec.md → Key Entities` with field-level detail and the canonical C types live in the respective module headers (`voice.h`, `gen.h`, `chord_progression.h`, `section.h`, `motif.h`, `wav.h`). Generation would be pure duplication.

`contracts/` was not populated because Stretto's only "interface" is its CLI + the on-disk `--seed N → WAV` reproducibility contract (already specified under FR-030..FR-034 and SC-002 in `spec.md`). There are no library APIs, plugin ABIs, network endpoints, or interchange formats to contract.

**Structure Decision**: Single fixed-binary layout — `Option 1: Single project` from `plan-template.md`. The dependency direction (per Constitution V) is:

```
main → {wav, audio, ui, gen, effects, voice, arena}
audio_* → {mixer, ui, keys, arena}
wav → {mixer, arena}
mixer → {gen, voice, effects}
keys → {ui, gen, voice, effects}
ui → {voice, gen, effects}
gen → {voice, lsystem, chord_progression, section, density, motif, effects}
voice → {arena, effects}
```

## Complexity Tracking

> No Constitution violations — table intentionally empty.

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| — | — | — |

The architecture stays well under the binary size budget (37 KB packed vs 48 KB ceiling) with 11 KB of headroom for future features, and well under the 128 KB arena (last measured ~25 KB peak). No principle is bent.

## Amendment history

- **2026-07-08** — Constitution v1.1.0 → v1.2.0: Principle I Linux UPX-packed binary budget added ≤30 KB per PR #121. The 003 MIDI-input chain's cross-platform MIDI support added the proportional ~13 KB UPX-packed growth on top of the historical pre-#117 Linux stripped `~40 KB with libpulse` measurement noted in the Constraints section above; v1.2.0 codifies the new cap explicitly, closing the implicit-loophole the prior Constitution left through Makefile `PACK_TARGET = 12288` (pre-#121) being half-reality. The current cap is ≤30 KB per `.specify/memory/constitution.md` Principle I amendment paragraph; Makefile `PACK_TARGET = 30720` enforces post-PR #121. (This 001 baseline plan predates the v1.1.0 amendment; the ≤24 KB Linux stripped target above is preserved as the spec-at-time-of-authoring claim per the integrity-preserving pattern.)
